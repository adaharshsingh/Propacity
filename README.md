# Weather Forecast Application

## Objective
This project is a weather forecast application built using React.js that fetches and displays weather data from a public API. The application emphasizes reusable components, API integration, state management, and a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Current Weather Display**: Shows the current weather for a default city (e.g., New York) with components for city name, temperature, weather condition, and an icon.
  
- **City Search Functionality**: Users can search for weather information for different cities using a custom-built input component, allowing for efficient and intuitive city lookup.

- **Five-Day Forecast**: Below the current weather, users can view a detailed 5-day weather forecast, including:
  - Day of the week
  - High and low temperatures
  - Weather icons for each day
  
- **Temperature Unit Conversion**: Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit, with manual conversion logic implemented to ensure accurate temperature displays.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is styled to be visually appealing and responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations.

- **Additional Features**:
  - Caching for the last searched city to enable offline viewing.
  - Pull-to-refresh functionality for updating weather data.
  - Performance optimizations like lazy loading components and optimizing API calls.

## Installation
To set up the Weather Forecast Application locally, follow these steps:
